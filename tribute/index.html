		<h3>His Contributions</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Devkota contributed to Nepali literature by starting a modern Nepali language romantic movement in the country. He was the first writer born in Nepal to begin writing epic poems in Nepali literature. Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of the language. </p>
		<p>Departing from the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at the time, and being inspired from the Newar language ballad song Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni, he wrote Muna Madan(1930AD), a long narrative poem in a popular folk tune. Muna Madan is one of the top selling book in Nepali market even after more then 9 decades. The 2003 film Muna Madan, which was Nepal's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, was based on this poem.</p>
		<p>The following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese culture. </p>
		<i><div><p>The son of a Kshatriya touches your feet not with hatred but with love.</p>
		<p>A man's greatness is determined by his heart; not by his caste or lineage.</p></div></i>
		<p>Devkota, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939, wrote a free-verse poem Pagal(The Lunatic). The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one of the best Nepali language poems. </p>
		<i><div><p>Surely, my friend, I am mad,</p>
			<p>That’s exactly what I am!</p>
			<p>I see a word,</p>
			<p>Hear sights,</p>
			<p>Taste smells,</p>
			<p>I touch things thinner than air,</p>
			<p>Those things,</p>
			<p>Whose existence the world denies,</p>
			<p>Whose shapes the world does not know.</p></div></i>
		<p>Devkota wrote Shakuntala, his first epic poem and also the first Mahakavya written in the Nepali language, in a mere three months. Published in 1945, Shakuntala is a voluminous work in 24 cantos based on Kālidāsa's famous Sanskrit play Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Shakuntala demonstrates Devkota's mastery of Sanskrit meter and diction which he incorporated heavily while working primarily in Nepali. According to the late scholar and translator of Devkota, David Rubin, Shakuntala is among his greatest accomplishments. "It is, without doubt, a remarkable work, a masterpiece of a particular kind, harmonizing various elements of a classical tradition with a modern point of view, a pastoral with a cosmic allegory, Kālidāsa's romantic comedy of earthly love with a symbolic structure that points to redemption through the coinciding of sensual and sacred love."</p>
		<p>Many of his poems focus on mundane elements of the human and the natural world. The titles of his poems like Ban ('The Woods'), Kisaan ('The Peasant'), Baadal ('Clouds') shows that he sought his poetic inspiration in the commonplace and proximal aspects of the world. What resonates throughout most of his poetry is his profound faith in humanity. For instance, in the poem Ban, the speaker goes through a series of interrogations, rejecting all forms of comfort and solace that could be offered solely to him as an individual. Instead, he embraces his responsibility and concern for his fellow beings. The poem ends with the following quatrain that highlights the speaker's humanistic inclinations:</p>
		<i><div><p>Where are your friends? Who goes with you? Which land is your home?</p>
			<p>
		What place do you seek, Traveller? With what news do you roam?</p>
		<p>
		My friend is decent diligence. Courage comes with me.</p>
		<p>
		The whole world is my home. To heartland I roam, with hues of humanity.</p>
		</div></i>
		<p>Besides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the essay genre. He is considered the father of the modern Nepali essay. He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings and eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali society. An essay titled Bhaladmi ('Gentleman') or criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled Ke Nepal Sano Cha? ('Is Nepal small'), he expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays book entitled Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha.</p>
		<p>Devkota also translated William Shakespeare's play Hamlet into Nepali.</p>

		<h3>Later Days(Health and Death)</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>In the late 1930s, Devkota suffered from nervous breakdowns, probably due to the death of his mother, father, and his two-month old daughter. Eventually, in 1939, he was admitted to the Mental Asylum of Ranchi, India, for five months. With financial debts later in his life and being unable to finance the weddings and dowries of his daughters, he is once reported to have said to his wife,<i>"Tonight let's abandon the children to the care of society and youth and renounce this world at bedtime and take potassium cyanide or morphine or something like that".</i></p>
		<p>Laxmi Prasad Devkota was a chain smoker throughout his life. After a long battle with cancer, Devkota died on 14 September 1959, at Aryaghat, along the banks of Bagmati river in Pashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu.</p>
		<p>Although stray Devkota poems, including several scribbled on the backs of cigarette-packets, continued to emerge for some years after the poet’s death, by the 1980s the Nepali world had probably concluded that his published oeuvre was complete.However in a complete surprise to  others, when his son Dr. Padma Devkota suddenly published a collection of 30 essays his father had written in English in or around the year 1958, the penultimate year of his life.
